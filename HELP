NAME
    index -- Retrieve reference genomes and MAGs from NCBI GenBank and build a Sequence Bloom Tree for each species with kmtricks

VERSION
    "$VERSION" ("$DATE")

SYNOPSIS
    index [--work-dir=directory] [--kmer-len=num] [--filter-size=num] 
          [--nproc=num] [--xargs-nproc=num] ...

DESCRIPTION
    This pipeline is used to automatically retrieve reference genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes from NCBI GenBank 
    and finally index them with kmtricks.

    The following options are available:

    --filter-size=num
        This is the size of the bloom filters

    -h|--help
        Print this help and exit
    
    --index-mags
        Download and index metagenome-assembled genomes from the NCBI GenBank
        Default: false

    --kingdom=value
        Consider genomes whose lineage belongs to a specific kingdom only

    --kmer-len=num
        This is the length of the kmers used for building bloom filters

    --license
        Print software license and exit
    
    --no-references
        Do not download and index reference genomes from isolate sequencing
        Default: true

    --nproc=num
        This argument refers to the number of processors used for parallelizing the pipeline when possible
        Default: --nproc=1

    --resolve-dependencies
        Search for external software dependencies and exit

    -v|--version
        Print current version and exit

    --work-dir=directory
        This is the working directory that will contain genomes organised by species and their index produced by kmtricks

    --xargs-nproc=num
        This refers to the number of xargs processes used for launching independent runs of kmtricks
        Default: --xargs-nproc=1

EXIT STATUS
    This script exits with one of the following values:

    0    The pipeline has been correctly applied.
    >0   An error occurred.

EXAMPLES
    Try running this script by typing:

        $ index --work-dir=~/myindex --kingdom=Bacteria --kmer-len 31 --filter-size 10000 --nproc 4 --xargs-nproc 2

NAME
    profile -- Query the sequence bloom trees at all the 7 taxonomic levels

VERSION
    "$VERSION" ("$DATE")

SYNOPSIS
    query [--input=file] [--tree=file] [--output=file] [--expand] ...

DESCRIPTION
    This tool is used to query a sequence bloom tree at different taxonomic levels.

    The following options are available:

    --expand
        Expand the input query on all the taxonomic levels
        Default: false
    
    -h|--help
        Print this help and exit

    --input=file
        This is the input file with the set of queries
    
    --license
        Print software license and exit
    
    --output-dir=directory
        This is the output folder with queries results

    --output-prefix=value
        Prefix of the output files with query matches
    
    --resolve-dependencies
        Search for external software dependencies and exit

    --threshold=num
        Fraction of query kmers that must be present in a leaf to be considered a match
        This must be between 0 and 1
        Default: 0.7

    --tree=file
        This is the tree definition file
    
    -v|--version
        Print current version and exit

EXIT STATUS
    This script exits with one of the following values:

    0    The pipeline has been correctly applied.
    >0   An error occurred.

EXAMPLES
    Try running this script by typing:

        $ profile --input=~/mag.fna --tree=~/mytree.txt --expand --output=~/matches.txt
