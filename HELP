NAME
    index -- Retrieve reference genomes and MAGs from NCBI GenBank and build a Sequence Bloom Tree for each species with kmtricks

VERSION
    "$VERSION" ("$DATE")

SYNOPSIS
    index [--work-dir=directory] [--kmer-len=num] [--filter-size=num] 
          [--nproc=num] [--xargs-nproc=num] ...

DESCRIPTION
    This pipeline is used to automatically retrieve reference genomes and metagenome-assembled genomes from NCBI GenBank 
    and finally index them with kmtricks.

    The following options are available:

    --filter-size=num
        This is the size of the bloom filters.

    -h|--help
        Print this help and exit

    --kmer-len=num
        This is the length of the kmers used for building bloom filters.

    --license
        Print software license and exit

    --nproc=num
        This argument refers to the number of processors used for parallelizing the pipeline when possible.
        Default: --nproc=1

    --resolve-dependencies
        Search for external software dependencies and exit

    -v|--version
        Print current version and exit

    --work-dir=directory
        This is the working directory that will contain genomes organised by species and their index produced by kmtricks.

    --xargs-nproc=num
        This refers to the number of xargs processes used for launching independent runs of kmtricks.
        Default: --xargs-nproc=1

EXIT STATUS
    This script exits with one of the following values:

    0    The pipeline has been correctly applied.
    >0   An error occurred.

EXAMPLES
    Try running this script by typing:

        $ index --work-dir=~/myindex --kmer-len 31 --filter-size 10000 --nproc 4 --xargs-nproc 2
